Running on top of an indico <a href="https://indico.io/product/custom-collections">Custom Collection</a>, our trained model can be used for large-scale content filtering. We integrated it with Facebook, with the purpose of helping users flag NSFW images that they're tagged in.

<b>What I learned:</b>
