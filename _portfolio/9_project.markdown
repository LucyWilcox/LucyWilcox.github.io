An Android application which listens to the user's voice and responds by displaying and reading aloud related, amusing Reddit comments.


<b>What I learned: </b>
- Leveraging existing tools is really helpful! We used an API which returns Reddit comments given a list of words they should contain made by Reddit user Stuck_In_the_Matrix, and Indico's machine learning APIs.
- It's helpful to get outside input from potential users frequently. Our team did this every one to two weeks and it was very helpful in guiding our development.
