During my gap year at before college I worked at several different jobs, this included coaching the varsity high school alpine skiing team and middle school track and field team. 

I coordinated trainings, transportation, race logistics, and managed the team's budget.

The team went on to have a great year!

<b>What I learned </b>
- It's important to make sure you stay in contact with all the different parties you're working with to make sure plans run smoothly
- How to communicate and set expectation with high schoolers
