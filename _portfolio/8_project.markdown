I've been involved with Human Powered Vehicles (HPV) since I arrived at Olin. In the past three years, I’ve helped design and manufacture a prone (superman) bike, created vehicle fairings out of carbon fiber and epoxy, and most recently lead the fairing and materials exploration sub-team. 

In the fall of 2016, as lead of the materials exploration team, I explored new materials which could be used in place of carbon fiber. With fewer team members than previous years and a smaller budget, I worked to find a way to create a faring under these constraints. Another goal the team had was to create a more environmentally friendly faring as carbon fiber is both taxing on the environment and the lungs of us when we work with it! I brew kombucha myself and after doing some research realized I could dry the SCOBY, which forms on top of the kombucha, to create a leather like material which is cheap and light. Next we started growing SCOBY cultures in large bins and even a swimming pool. In the spring I left to study abroad in Copenhagen and it remains to be seen if SCOBY has worked or if the team is using canvas as back up material. Regardless I’ll be rooting for the team at the competition later this spring.

<b>What I learned: </b>
- How to get a team excited about my seemingly crazy ideas!
- How the mechanical engineering process works. I think it's good to know, even as a software engineer.
