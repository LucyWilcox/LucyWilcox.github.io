I made Black Ducks’s OpenHub.com, a wiki for OSS, more aligned with the company’s direction by introducing project security information. First I explored site usage data, created user personas, and determined some high level use cases. I combined this with research on what information sources were available to us and how we could integrate with them to make a plan that my team member, Ashrith, and I could move forward with. We then developed proof-of-concepts for many different graphs.  
  
I then held demos and communicated with engineering, UI/UX, and marketing to select a final set of displays and a new, responsive, page layout. After writing detailed product specifications and users stories the rest of the Open Hub team started the development of the project.  
  
I also proposed, documented, and started implementation of an integration with GitHub in my last few weeks. 

What I learned:

- It's fine to spend time brainstorming and doing proof of concepts for a lot of ideas then throw most of them away and use what your learned.  
- How to architect a technical solution, though I won't be the implementing it all.  
- Though I planned what engineering would focused on, any decision I made impacted all departments - keep in communication with them. 
- Writing really really good JIRA tickets :)
