My team and I explored an aging couple’s daily life and discovered a need for a gardening chair with minimal impact on the knees. We gathered functional, interaction, and character requirements to design and build chair.

Through getting to know community partners Jim and Joan Pratt, we observed that Jim values the well­being of his wife above anything else, so with this in mind we decided to focus our project on designing a product that directly aids Joan. Based on the Pratt's needs, values, and aspirations, we explored the opportunity area of mobility, with specific subcategories within this area ranging from driving to feeling more comfortable while grocery shopping, and gardening. Because Joan has been passionate about the outdoors her entire life and gardening is a medium through which she can engage her love of nature, creativity, and most importantly independence, we decided on the opportunity area of gardening. 

Joan’s specific challenges with gardening as she has gotten older have most notably involved a surgery on her knees after a fall she endured a few years ago and an inability to move her neck due to arthritis. Consequently, we made a product that allows Joan to garden independently while lessening the impact of her physical limitations. After much brainstorming, prototyping, and iterating, we made a rocking, light­weight garden stool which allows Joan to be close to her garden and maintain a sense of stability without putting pressure on her knees or forcing her to move her neck.

	The final product! Made out of tri-walled cardboard and coated in Styrospray 1000, paint, and sealant. Black foam pads are included for comfort and to reduce the chance of Joan slipping.

<b>What I learned:</b>
- Spending time empathizing with those you are designing for is very important. This allowed us to realize that though certain solutions like a raised bed would help Joan garden they change the aesthetics of her garden that she valued greatly
- Having a list of non-negotiable functional requirements is useful to have and refer to frequently
- If possible, chose materials that you can prototype quickly with – cardboard was great as we could make changes in the moment with Joan present and get feedback on them
