Explored an aging couple’s daily life and discovered a need for a gardening chair with minimal impact on the knees. Gathered functional, interaction, and character requirements to design and build chair.

We worked with community partners Jim and Joan Pratt. Through getting to know Jim and Joan, we observed that Jim values the well­being of his wife above anything else, so with this in mind we decided to focus our project on designing a product that directly aids Joan. Based on the Pratt's needs, values, and aspirations, we explored the opportunity area of mobility, with specific subcategories within this area ranging from driving to feeling more comfortable while grocery shopping, and gardening. Because Joan has been passionate about the outdoors her entire life and gardening is a medium through which she can engage her love of nature, creativity, and most importantly independence, we decided on the opportunity area of gardening. 

Joan’s specific challenges with gardening as she has gotten older have most notably involved a surgery on her knees after a fall she endured a few years ago and an inability to move her neck due to arthritis. Consequently, we made a product that allows Joan to garden independently while lessening the impact of her physical limitations. After much brainstorming, prototyping, and iterating, we made a rocking, light­weight garden stool which allows Joan to be close to her garden and maintain a sense of stability without putting pressure on her knees or forcing her to move her neck.
