MindFlo is an app that enable users to understand, reflect, and improve on their interaction with technology. MindFlo is designed to be potentially feasible in twenty years and come in the form of a wooden sticker that can be placed on the back of a laptop or electronic device. In theory it could use wireless energy transfer and electro-magnetic waves to power itself and determine what applications and sites the user is visiting. By taking the form of a sticker, MindFlo separates itself from the technology people sometimes struggle with, and doesn't add additional clutter into one's life. MindFlo does not judgementally tell users what their habits should be, but instead provides them with a meaningful visualization of their online patterns so that they can take control and make changes!  
​  
MindFlo is designed for the most unreceptive group for new products, minimalist, but is applicable to anyone who wants to improve their relationship with technology. Decisions about what general product direction the team would head in and specific design requirements were determined by extensive user interviews and co-designs.

<b> What I learned: </b>

- Getting lift-off from users without feeling the need to design exactly what they ask for.
- The words you use to describe what you're designing are crucial.
- Making quick, visual prototypes stimulates creativity and improves communication.
- Sometimes talking as a group is conducive to ideating, but five minute silent sessions with sharing and discussion are also important!
- Test your ideas out with real data / in real situations to understand concretely how they will behave.

	Creating personas from interviews.
</div>

We created four personas from interviewing several dozen minimalists. 

Meditative Madison values mental freedom, they don't like things getting in the way of their life.

Environmentalist Emory believes that the "the world has enough to meet everyone's needs, but not everyone's greed" and

Hobbyist Hansel is a minimalist so they can focus their time and money on what they are passionate about.

Frugal Finley embraces minimalism to reduce their spending.

We decided to move forward focusing on Meditative Madison and Environmentalist Emory.

From here we teased out the most pressing issues minimalists face and what we could do to alleviate them.

From here we brainstormed different solution areas and, relfecting the data we collected from interviews, created MindFlo.
