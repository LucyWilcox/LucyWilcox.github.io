MindFlo is an app that enable users to understand, reflect, and improve on their interaction with technology. MindFlo is designed to be potentially feasible in twenty years and come in the form of a wooden sticker that can be placed on the back of a laptop or electronic device. In theory it could use wireless energy transfer and electro-magnetic waves to power itself and determine what applications and sites the user is visiting. By taking the form of a sticker, MindFlo separates itself from the technology people sometimes struggle with, and doesn't add additional clutter into one's life. MindFlo does not judgementally tell users what their habits should be, but instead provides them with a meaningful visualization of their online patterns so that they can take control and make changes!  
​  
MindFlo is designed for the most unreceptive group for new products, minimalist, but is applicable to anyone who wants to improve their relationship with technology. Decisions about what general product direction the team would head in and specific design requirements were determined by extensive user interviews and co-designs.

What I learned:

- Getting lift-off from users without feeling the need to design exactly what they ask for.
- The words you use to describe what you're designing are crucial.
- Making quick, visual prototypes stimulates creativity and improves communication.
- Sometimes talking as a group is conducive to ideating, but five minute silent sessions with sharing and discussion are also important!
- Test your ideas out with real data / in real situations to understand concretely how they will behave.

<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/needvalasp.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/howmightwe.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/223.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
</div>
<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/5.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	This image can also have a caption. It's like magic. 
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images. Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images. You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then.... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.


<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col two" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/6.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/11.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple. Just add a col class to your image, and another class specifying the width: one, two, or three columns wide. Here's the code for the last row of images above: 

	<div class="img_row">
	  <img class="col two" src="/img/6.jpg"/>
	  <img class="col one" src="/img/11.jpg"/>
	</div>
