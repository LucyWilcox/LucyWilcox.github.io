A Google Chrome extension that allow groups or couples to see the same image as a background when they open a new tab. They can link this with a Tumblr feed for personalized images. Backend built using Flask REST APIs on Heroku with PostgreSQL.


<b>What I learned:</b>
- How to set up a database myself. This was my first time going through the whole process.
- Creating a MVP then going back adding/improving functionality, like storing images in localstorage, helped keep us excited about building this project!
- That said, if a project isn't thought out extremely well, there's going to be refactoring to be done - there's still some refactoring that needs to be done here.
