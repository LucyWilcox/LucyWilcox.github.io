Bike & Chill incentivizes exercise by tracking mileage travelled on a bike and connecting that data to your computer.

With a Chrome extension, you can block sites like Netflix or Facebook where the sites only unlock once you've biked your set distance.

<b>What I learned:</b>
- When working on projects with many different elements (in this case, mechanical, electrical, and software) it makes life easier if they are all integrated each step along the way
- It's important to research and make sure you are using the right tool before moving forward
